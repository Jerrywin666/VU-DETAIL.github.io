      <h2>Welcome to the MESL website</h2>
      <p>The Microelectronic Embedded Systems Laboratory is part of the 
	  Computer Science and Engineering department at UCSD and is led by  
	  <a href=http://mesl.ucsd.edu/gupta>Professor Rajesh Gupta</a>. We are interested in most aspects of
	  embedded computer systems and sensor networks. 
	  <br><br>
	  Our recent research 
	  focus has been on energy efficiency at multiple levels and across subsystems 
	  (radios, processors to networking and building-scale systems). The research
	  projects span formal foundations to real-life system design and implementations.
	  <br><br>
	  Prospective students who are interested in joining our lab should check out our <a href=site/aboutus.html> About Us</a>
	  page. We are always looking for good students. </p>
