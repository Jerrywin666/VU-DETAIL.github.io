**Energy-efficient Neural Networks with Low-precision Parameters**

Neural networks achieve success in various application domains such as image processing, speech recognition, and medical diagnostics. However, the intensive computation workload of neural networks incurs high energy consumption, limiting its deployment in low-power devices. In this project, we are trying to reduce the computation workload of neural networks by lowering the parameter precision. For example, we can transform a floating-point multiplication into a fixed-point multiplication. The challenge here is how to assign proper precision to different parameters to maximize the energy savings while keeping the accuracy of neural networks. To solve this, we will explore different optimization algorithm and neural network implementation to validate the approach.
